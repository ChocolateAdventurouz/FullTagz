# FullTagz - The best app in terms of auto-tagging
![bg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChocolateAdventurouz/FullTagz/readme-res/bg.jpg)
This application finds the metadata on the songs which are untitled-unnamed (e.g Unknown Artist - Track 1, etc). Using the power of the acoustic algorithm of Shazam, it tries to find the song with a big rate of success, and by using the big library collection from Discogs, it fills your tags, so you have a clean & organized library!

## Depending Libraries:
- ShzamIO (for the Shazam access)
- Discogs Python API (for the song metadata/info)
- Mutagen EasyID3 (for the tag editing)
- Tkinter (for the filedialog UI)

## News
More things are coming soon (Discogs API Usage, Better performance, and more)!
